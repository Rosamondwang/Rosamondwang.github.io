Welcome to my website! 

I am Yirong Wang. I am a PhD Candidate in Finance at the University of Bristol, Business School (starting from Oct 2021), where I have been fully funded by the School’s PhD Scholarship. My research interests lie in **empirical asset pricing, international finance, macro-finance, and return predictability**, with a particular emphasis on risk-based explanations for variations in asset prices across international markets. 

I hold a research master’s degree in Advanced Studies in Economics and a master's degree in Business Economics from KU Leuven, Belgium, and a bachelor’s degree in Economics from the University of Warsaw, Poland. I was born and raised in Urumqi, Xinjiang Province, China, where my favorite foods are *pilaf* (抓饭 pilav) and *naan* (馕 náng).


***I will be on the job market in 2025–26.***


Upcoming trips:

EURO-FIDAI Paris December 2025; AFA in Philadelphia 2026

## Working Papers

**Deviations from Covered Interest Rate Parity, Dollar Funding Pressure, and Currency Risk Premium (Job Market Paper)**
<p align="justify">
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between deviations from Covered Interest Rate Parity (CIP)
and the cross-sectional variation in currency risk premia. Motivated by the currency hedging channel proposed
by Liao and Zhang (2025), I interpret the CIP violations as a measure of postcrisis dollar funding pressure,
reflecting imbalances between excessive dollar hedging demand and constrained funding supply. Utilizing G10
currency data, I show that currencies with higher unconditional cross-currency basis values yield significantly
higher excess returns, indicating compensation for bearing greater dollar funding pressure risk. A tradable
trading strategy that longs in currencies with high basis and shorts currencies with low basis, referred to as the
*global cross-currency basis* factor, delivers economically large and statistically significant returns, explaining
a substantial portion of cross-sectional variation in currency returns and outperforming standard risk factors after the crisis. Moreover, the basis factor subsumes information embedded in nominal interest differentials (i.e., carry trade)
and global trade and capital flow imbalances in the postcrisis period, providing an additional risk-based
explanation of the forward premium puzzle.

**Capturing Time-Varying Return Predictability: the Multi-Asset Momentum Strategy with Dynamic Trading Signals** with Richard D.F. Harris and Nick Taylor (Revise & Resubmit at Management Science)

<p align="justify">
Abstract: This paper uncovers a time-varying predictable pattern in returns across the bond, equity, and forex markets. Exploiting these time variations in cross-asset return predictability, we develop a dynamic approach to generate out-of-sample trading signals that are employed in a diversified multi-asset time series momentum(M-XTSM) strategy. This approach effectively converts return forecasts into economic gains by allowing investors to adjust their trading positions in real-time in response to changing business cycles. Applying this method to data from 20 developed countries, we show that the M-XTSM strategy delivers substantial abnormal returns with little exposure to standard asset pricing factors and consistently outperforms existing momentum strategies, especially during market downturns. The M-XTSM strategy encompasses the traditional time series momentum (Moskowitz et al., 2012), and its outperformance is not driven by time-varying aggregate market behaviors, rendering it a distinct new phenomenon from cross-sectional momentum (Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993).
